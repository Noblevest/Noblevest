<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.6 </span>You must comply with any information request we send to you. If you decline to provide the requested information, or otherwise do not comply in a timely manner, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to your Account, or to all or part of the Services immediately, without notice.</p>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, if there is any inconsistency between the information available on or via the Platform, and the information in our records, our records will prevail unless there is a Manifest Error. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.9</span> You are responsible for checking the Account History for errors. You must report to us if there are any mistaken or unauthorized entries or Transactions within five (5) calendar days of the date that your Account History is provided or made available to you. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.10 </span>We may rectify any error in your Account History at any time, and reserve the right to void, cancel or reverse any Transaction involving or deriving from an error or to make any corresponding adjustments to such Transaction to correct a mistake or if we have reasonable grounds for doing so. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.11 </span>We may be required under these Terms or Applicable Law to share information about your Account and Account History with third parties and/or our Affiliates. You acknowledge and agree that we are entitled to disclose such information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Account Security </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.12 </span>You are responsible for taking appropriate actions to protect your hardware and data from viruses and malicious software, and any inappropriate materials. Except as provided by Applicable Law, you are responsible for backing up and maintaining duplicate copies of any information you store or transfer through the Services. We are not responsible for any claim or losses resulting from your failure to comply with this clause.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.13 </span>You and any Authorized Person shall maintain adequate security and control of all Account Credentials at all times. You and the Authorized Persons are responsible for taking the necessary security measures to protect your Account and to keep the Account Credentials secure. You must keep the Account Credentials secure against any attacks and unauthorized access. You must notify us immediately if you have knowledge or have reason to suspect that the security of your Account or your email associated with your Account, or that of an Authorized Person, has been compromised or if there has been any unauthorized use of your or any Authorized Person's Account or email account. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.14 </span>It is important that you monitor your Account History to ensure any unauthorized or suspicious activity on your Account is identified and notified to us as soon as possible. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.15 </span>If you suspect a security breach, you must ensure that we are notified immediately and continue to be provided with accurate and up-to-date information throughout the duration of the security breach. Your Account will be immediately locked via the disable account function on the Platform or via any other method as may be prescribed by us from time to time. You will take any other steps that we may reasonably require to reduce, manage or report any security breach. We reserve the right to request, and you agree to promptly provide, any and all information and documents we deem relevant or necessary in connection with an actual or suspected security breach.  You further acknowledge and agree that we may provide such information to any third party that we deem necessary in order to investigate or resolve any security breach. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Closing your Account</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.16 </span>You may terminate your Account at any time by following the account termination procedures as prescribed by us from time to time. You will be required to pay any outstanding amounts owed to us. You authorize us to cancel or suspend any pending transactions at the time of cancellation, and to deduct any outstanding amounts that you owe us from your Account.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">5.17 </span>You may not be able to close your Account, in situations where:</p>
<p>(i) you are trying to evade an investigation by relevant authorities;</p>
<p>(ii) you have a pending Transaction or an outstanding claim;</p>
<p>(iii) your Account has any outstanding amounts owed to us; </p>
<p>(iv) your Account is subject to a freeze, hold, limitation or reserve;</p>
<p>(v) other reasons at our sole discretion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">6. Transactions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">6.1 </span>You may enter into Transactions directly with us, or directly with other users, which may or may not be facilitated by us. We do not represent or warrant that any Transaction will be completed successfully or within a specific time period. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">6.2 </span>You are responsible for the control and use of your Account. You, or an Authorized Person, are deemed to have authorized any Instruction sent from your Account. It is your responsibility to monitor your Account History to ensure any unauthorized or suspicious activity on your Account is identified and notified to us as soon as possible. We are not responsible for any claim or losses resulting from a Transaction executed as a result of an unauthorized Instruction, including whether by mistake, negligence, error or fraud, unless it is proven that the unauthorized Instruction is solely due to a technical issue attributable to us.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">6.3 </span>To comply with data retention requirements, you agree to permit us (but agree to not require us) to keep a record of all Transaction information for the lifetime of your Account as long as it is required to fulfill their intended purposes, or such other period as prescribed by Applicable Law. Please read our<a href="/support/articles/360015150651" rel> Privacy Policy</a> to understand how we collect and use data relating to the use of our Platform and Services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">6.4 </span>We may rectify any error in your Account History at any time, and reserve the right to void, cancel or adjust any Transaction involving or deriving from a Manifest Error or to amend the details of such Transaction to reflect what we reasonably consider to be the correct or fair details of such Transaction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">6.5 </span>You acknowledge and agree that if Noblevest identifies any Transaction with Improper Intent and/or in the case of Manifest Error, Noblevest is authorized (without any payment or penalty or liability due by Noblevest and provided that such action is in compliance with Applicable Law) to either:</p>
<p>(i) cancel/void any Transaction and adjust any transfer of Digital Assets that have been made to and/or from your Noblevest Account in connection with such Transaction and treat such Transaction as if it had never been entered into; or</p>
<p>(ii) amend the price(s) of any Transaction to reflect what we reasonably consider to be the correct or fair details of such Transaction or the prevailing market price(s) as determined by us as at the relevant time at our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>In addition, we may adjust or deduct any profit generated in connection with such Transaction that we reasonably consider to be abnormal, abusive or unfair from your Noblevest Account.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible for your own transactions with any third parties that may have been entered into in connection with or reliance on any Transaction(s) that may be subject to any cancellation/amendment pursuant to our rights herein.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Transaction Limits</span></p>
<p><strong class="normal"><span class="bold">6.7 </span>We reserve the right to change any Transaction limit that applies to your Account at any time at our sole and absolute discretion. It may also be possible for you to request a change in your limits. Any change will be made at our absolute discretion and will be subject to any further conditions that we deem necessary. </strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">6.7 </span>We reserve the right to change any Transaction limit that applies to your Account at any time at our sole and absolute discretion. It may also be possible for you to request a change in your limits. Any change will be made at our absolute discretion and will be subject to any further conditions that we deem necessary. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">7. Instruction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">7.1 </span>You must ensure that any Instruction submitted is complete and accurate. We are not required to verify the accuracy, authenticity or validity of any Instruction and will not monitor or reject Instructions on the basis that they are, or appear to be, duplicates. However, if we have doubts as to the accuracy, authenticity or validity of an Instruction, we may refuse to act upon or defer acting upon any Instruction, or seek further information from you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">7.2 </span>Instructions are irrevocable. You have no right to rescind or withdraw an Instruction without our written consent once it has been submitted by you or the Authorized Person(s). Your Instruction is not deemed to be received by us until it has been received by our server. Our record of all Instructions shall be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">7.3 </span>By submitting an Instruction, you or the Authorized Person are authorizing us to initiate the Transaction on your Account. We are therefore authorized to credit or debit (or provide settlement information to third parties for the purposes of the third party crediting or debiting) your Digital Assets from your Account in accordance with your Instruction. It is your responsibility to hold sufficient Digital Assets credited in your Account. If you have insufficient Digital Assets in your Account to effect the Transaction (i.e., less than the required amount to settle the Transaction and to pay all the fees associated with the Transaction), then we have the right to refuse to effect any Transaction. Noblevest may also refuse to act on instructions to the extent permitted by these Terms. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">7.4 </span>You are aware that Instructions and information transmitted on the Platform or by email are generally transmitted via the internet and may be routed via public, transnational installations that are not specifically protected. We cannot guarantee that the Instructions and information transmitted will be completely protected against unauthorized access, and you accept the associated risks.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">7.5 </span>Subject to these Terms and any applicable Product Terms, and provided that you have sufficient balance on your Account and the relevant Digital Assets are not on hold in your Account in connection with any Service, you may give Instructions to Noblevest to transfer Digital Assets to an external wallet address by submitting a withdrawal request on the Platform. Upon receipt of the withdrawal request, We will (i) deduct your Account balance; and (ii) initiate an on-chain transfer to an external wallet designated by you. We may not process a withdrawal request if, in our opinion, we consider that Applicable Law prevents the execution of the relevant withdrawal. We may also suspend withdrawals at such time deemed appropriate by us to resolve any incidents on the Platform. We will resume withdrawals once such incidents have been resolved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8. Termination, Suspension and Restrictions </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8.1 </span>Noblevest may at any time modify, suspend or discontinue any portion or feature of the Services without prior notice to or any consent from you and without assigning any reason for that action. </p>

<p>(ii) we reasonably suspect that (a) the person logged into your Account is not you, or that the Account has been or will be used for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes; (b) the person logged into your Corporate Account is not an Authorized Person, or the Corporate Account has been or will be used for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes; (c) more than one natural person has access to and/or transacts using the same Account, or that your Account has been or will be used for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes; or (d) information provided by you is wrong, untruthful, outdated, or incomplete;</p>
<p>(iii) we have reasonable concerns in relation to your creditworthiness or financial status, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>where you are an individual, you become bankrupt, of unsound mind, commit an act of bankruptcy, or have action to place you in bankruptcy commenced against you;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where you are acting on behalf of a partnership, any of the partners die or become bankrupt or of unsound mind, commit an act of bankruptcy, or have action to place any of the partners in bankruptcy commenced, or if action is commenced to dissolve and/or alter the partners or the constitutions of the partnership;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where you are acting on behalf of a corporation, the corporation is unable to pay its debts as and when they are due, or action is commenced to place the corporation in insolvency, judicial management, receivership, administrative management, or any similar or analogous proceedings; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you convene a meeting of your creditors or propose or make any compromise or arrangement with or any assignment for the benefit of your creditors;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(iv) pending submission of such information and documents in accordance with clause 5;</p>
<p>(v) pending submission of enhanced due diligence in accordance with clause ‎5.3(iv);</p>
<p>(vi) we reasonably consider that we are required to do so by Applicable Law, or any court or authority to which we are subject in any jurisdiction;</p>
<p>(vii) we have determined or suspect:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>you have breached these Terms or any Product Terms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have breached any express or implied warranties in these Terms or any representations you have made;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that any Transaction is unauthorized, erroneous, fraudulent, or unlawful or we have determined or suspect that your Account or the Services are being used in a fraudulent, unauthorized, or unlawful manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is any occurrence of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud or any other crime in connection with your Account or your use of the Services;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(viii) the use of your Account is subject to any pending, ongoing or threatened litigation, investigation, or judicial, governmental or regulatory proceedings and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your Account activity;</p>
<p>(ix) you owe amounts to Noblevest that are not satisfied, whether due to a chargeback or on any other basis;</p>
<p>(x) any communication to your email account is returned as undeliverable;</p>
<p>(xi) an issue has arisen with the verification of your identity;</p>
<p>(xii) you have taken any action that may circumvent our controls such as opening multiple Accounts without our written consent or abusing promotions that we may offer from time to time; or</p>
<p>(xiii) there is any other valid reason which means we need to do so.</p>
<p>In addition to any other rights under these Terms, Noblevest may suspend, terminate and/or replace an Account at any time and without notice to you if we believe this is necessary or desirable to enable us to comply with Applicable Law. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8.2</span> You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<p>(i) the examples set out in clause ‎8.1 above on when we might take action to terminate, suspend, close or restrict your access to your Account and/or the Services is a non-exhaustive list; and</p>
<p>(ii) our decision to take certain actions, including without limitation, to terminate, suspend, close or restrict your access to your Account and/or the Services, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our risk management and security protocols. We are not obliged to disclose details of our risk management and security protocols to you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8.3</span> Where we terminate, suspend, hold or restrict your access to one or more Services:</p>
<p>(i) depending on the circumstances, if you have Instructions, trades, positions or Transactions that are open, they may be closed by you, or by us;</p>
<p>(ii) any chargeback resulting from the use of your Account or Services may result in an immediate suspension and/or restriction of your Account and Services;</p>
<p>(iii) to re-activate suspended and/or restricted Account or Services, you may be required to reimburse us for the full value of the chargeback, including any amounts that are owing to us such as any applicable fees; and</p>
<p>(iv) you are liable for any credited amounts in case of a chargeback, and you authorize and grant us the right to deduct costs and fees directly from any assets in your Account without notice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8.4 Unlawful possession.</span> If we are informed and reasonably believe that any Digital Assets held in your Account are stolen or otherwise are not lawfully possessed by you (whether by Manifest Error or otherwise), we may, but have no obligation to, place a hold on the affected funds and your Account. Where we place a hold on some or all of any Digital Assets held in your Account, or on your entire Account, we may continue such hold until such time as evidence, acceptable to us, proves that you are entitled to possession of the Digital Assets held in your Account. We will not get involved in any dispute, or the resolution of the dispute, relating to any Digital Assets held in your Account. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">8.5 Access in other jurisdictions.</span> Residents of some countries may only be able to access some, but not all, Services. The Services that are available to you may change from time to time. If you travel to a Prohibited Country, the Services may not be available and your access to the Services may be blocked. You acknowledge that this may impact your ability to trade on the Platform and/or monitor any existing orders or open positions or otherwise use the Services. You must not attempt in any way to circumvent any such restriction, including by use of any virtual private network to modify your internet protocol address.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">9. Available Digital Assets</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">9.1</span> Noblevest will only provide the Services for the Available Digital Assets. We may remove or suspend one or more Available Digital Assets and we will use reasonable commercial efforts to notify you in advance, meaning that you will no longer be able to access such Digital Assets as part of the Services and will only be permitted to withdraw such Digital Assets from your Account. If Digital Assets that are no longer Available Digital Assets remain in your Account beyond a specified period notified to you, Noblevest may, at its reasonable discretion, convert such Digital Assets into a different type of Digital Asset that is a stablecoin. Noblevest shall notify you in advance of any conversion and you may withdraw such Digital Assets within the specified time prior to such conversion. </p>
<p>We assume no liability in connection with any attempt to use your Account for Digital Assets that we do not support nor for the conversion to a different type of Digital Asset, as described in this clause. If you send unsupported Digital Assets to an Account or Available Digital Assets to an incompatible Digital Asset wallet address, then you will lose those Digital Assets and we assume no liability or obligation whatsoever. For some lost Digital Assets, Noblevest may, at its sole discretion, offer you the option to attempt a recovery. We may charge fees to process the recovery attempt on your behalf. We will calculate all fees at our discretion, and notify you of the applicable fees at or before the time you authorize the recovery attempt. We do not guarantee in any way the amount of assets (if any) that may be recovered in a recovery attempt. The actual amount recovered may differ from the estimated recovery amount. We do not evaluate or provide any assurance as to the authenticity, safety, or security of unsupported Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that Noblevest is not liable for any loss incurred during the recovery attempt or subsequent use of the recovered Digital Asset.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">9.2</span> Noblevest may temporarily suspend any Services in relation to a particular Digital Asset to determine whether or not to support a Fork. We are under no obligation to support a Fork of a Digital Asset that you hold in your Account, regardless of whether any resulting version of such Forked Digital Asset is a Dominant Digital Asset or not. If we elect to support a Fork of a Digital Asset, we will make a public announcement through our Website or by such other means as we may deem appropriate.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that we have no control over, nor do we have the ability to influence, the creation or implementation of a Fork. We can provide no assurances about the security, functionality or supply of any Digital Asset, including both the new Dominant Digital Asset or other Digital Assets subject to the relevant Fork. You may not be able to trade the Forked Digital Assets on the Platform and you may lose any value associated with the relevant Digital Assets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">9.3</span> Noblevest makes no promises, guarantees or warranties on the outcome of or support for potential or proposed Forks, Forked Digital Assets or Airdrops. Noblevest may determine at its sole discretion whether to claim, list or distribute any Airdrop, Forked Digital Asset or any other Digital Asset, as well as the terms and conditions (including eligibility criteria) that will apply to any claim, listing or distribution of any Airdrop or Forked Digital Asset. If you wish to participate in a Fork or Airdrop, please withdraw the affected Digital Asset to your own private wallet well ahead of the potential or proposed Fork or Airdrop.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">9.4</span> We may, from time to time, support Digital Assets that purport to be backed by or otherwise tied or pegged in value to another asset, including without limitation, Digital Assets, or commodities such as silver or gold ("<span style="font-weight:bold;">Backed Digital Assets</span>"). You acknowledge and agree that (i) you have read, understood and accepted all of the terms and conditions and risks associated with each particular Backed Digital Asset before entering into any Transaction relating to that Backed Digital Asset and (ii) Noblevest does not, and will not in any circumstances, have any no obligation whatsoever to purchase, repurchase or effect or facilitate the redemption of your Backed Digital Assets. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any Services in relation to any Backed Digital Asset at any time at our sole and absolute discretion. We make no representation as to whether any particular Backed Digital Asset will hold its value as against any asset, nor as to the amount or quality of reserves or collateral held by each issuer or any third party in relation to any Backed Digital Asset.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">10. Intellectual Property</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">10.1 Noblevest IP Rights.</span> The Noblevest IP Rights shall remain vested in Noblevest. Noblevest hereby grants to you a non-exclusive license for the duration of these Terms, or until we suspend or terminate your access to the Services, whichever is sooner, to use the Noblevest IP Rights, excluding the Trade Marks, solely as necessary to allow you to receive the Services for non-commercial personal or internal business use, in accordance with these Terms.</p>

If requested to do so, you shall (and agree to procure that any agents, representatives or contractors shall), without charge to us, sign and/or execute all documents and do all such acts as we may require to perfect the assignments under this clause.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">10.4 User Materials.</span> You agree and acknowledge that: (i) we are not responsible for any User Materials (whether provided by you or by third parties) which may be made available on the Platform or the Website; and (ii) use of such User Materials is at your own risk and that we do not provide any warranties in relation to the same. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">10.5 Our Rights on User Materials.</span> We shall have the right at our sole and absolute discretion to remove, modify or reject any content that you submit to, post or display on the Platform or the Website (including any User Materials) for any reason. We reserve the right to take any actions as we deem appropriate at our sole discretion, including giving a written warning to you, removing any User Materials, recovering damages or other monetary compensation from you, suspending or terminating your Account (if any), or suspending your access to the Platform and/or the Website. We shall also have the right to restrict or ban you from any and all future use of Services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">11. Prohibited Use</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">11.1</span> By opening an Account or carrying out any Transaction, and without prejudice to any other restriction or limitation set out in these Terms, you agree that you and any Authorized Person will not:</p>
<p>(i) breach these Terms or any agreement entered into pursuant to, or in connection with, these Terms, including, but not limited to, any Product Terms;</p>
<p>(ii) use Services for resale or commercial purposes, including transactions on behalf of other persons or entities, unless expressly agreed by us in writing;</p>

<p>(vii) provide false, inaccurate or misleading information in connection with your use of the Services, in communications with us, or otherwise in connection with these Terms;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">17.2</span> Noblevest will try to notify users prior to amendments to these Terms taking effect.  However, we may occasionally need to make changes that are effective immediately, in which case users will be notified as soon as possible after the changes take effect. Amendments that may take effect immediately include and without limitation, where amendments are to (i) address legal and/or regulatory requirements; or (ii) make these Terms clearer. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">17.3</span> Save where amendments come into effect immediately, any update to the Terms will come into effect after the changes have been notified to users.

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">18. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">18.1 Governing Law.</span> These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong without regard to any choice or conflict of laws rules. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">18.2 Claim Notice. </span>To the extent permitted by law, you agree to waive your rights to any jury trial and for any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms resolved in court. For any dispute or claim that you have against Noblevest or relating in any way to these Terms, you agree to first contact Noblevest and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("<span style="font-weight:bold;">Notice</span>") to us by email at "legal@Noblevest.com". </p>
<p>The Notice must: </p>
<p>(i) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; </p>
<p>(ii) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and </p>
<p>(iii) state the specific relief sought. </p>
<p>If you and Noblevest cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration as prescribed below.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">18.3 Dispute Resolution.</span> Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim between you and Noblevest (and/or any of its Affiliates) arising out of, in connection with, or relating in any way to: (a) these Terms or any Product Terms, including the existence, validity, subject matter, interpretation, performance, breach, negotiation, termination, enforceability or the consequences of their nullity thereof; (b) your relationship with Noblevest (and/or any of its Affiliates) as a user (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms); and (c) any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to these Terms, or any Product Terms, or your relationship with Noblevest (and/or any of its Affiliate), shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("<span style="font-weight:bold;">HKIAC</span>") under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when arbitration is commenced. The arbitral award shall be final and binding. The arbitration provisions set forth in this clause will survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>You and we agree that: </p>
<p>(i) the law of this clause is Hong Kong law; </p>
<p>(ii) the seat of arbitration will be Hong Kong; </p>
<p>(iii) the arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English;</p>
<p>(iv) unless you and we agree otherwise, the number of arbitrators will be 1 and that arbitrator must have relevant legal and technological expertise; </p>
<p>(v) if you and we do not agree on the arbitrator to be appointed within 15 working days of the dispute proceeding to arbitration, the arbitrator shall be appointed by HKIAC; </p>
<p>(vi) the arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>consolidate more than one individual's claims; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preside over any type of class or representative proceeding; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any claim to be brought by you arising out of or related to these Terms must commence arbitration proceedings strictly within one year after such claim arises failing which it shall be irrevocably time-barred. Time-barred claims mean that there is no longer any lawful right to assert such claims nor to commence any formal legal action. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, you agree that we have the right to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) or equitable relief in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>You agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use: </p>
<p>(i) is personal to you and Noblevest; and </p>
<p>(ii) will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.  </p>
<p>If any portion of this clause is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason:</p>
<p>(i) only the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed/deleted;</p>
<p>(ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision should have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this clause or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this clause; and </p>
<p>(iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims should be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">18.4 Confidentiality.</span> The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential. The existence of the arbitration, the existence or content of a claim, all documents and information provided or exchanged in connection with the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration shall be kept confidential and no party shall disclose any of the foregoing to any third party except the tribunal, the HKIAC, the parties, their counsels, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other persons necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose such confidential information in the event that: </p>
<p>(i) the written consent of the other party is obtained;</p>
<p>(ii) to the extent required by Applicable Law or by the regulations of any regulatory or supervisory authority of competent jurisdiction to which the party is or may become subject to or pursuant to any order of a court or other competent authority or tribunal of competent jurisdiction;</p>
<p>(iii) in connection with the commencement, pursuit or defense by a party of any bona fide legal proceedings to enforce or challenge any award rendered in the arbitration; and</p>
<p>(iv) to the extent that the relevant confidential information is in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of these Terms.</p>
<p>The confidentiality obligation in this clause shall survive termination of these Terms and conclusion or stay of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.</p>
<p> </p>
